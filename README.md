Repository Name: Well-Formed-Parentheses-Generator

Description:

A Python solution for generating all possible combinations of well-formed parentheses. This repository contains an efficient iterative implementation using lists to manage the combination generation process without recursion. The Solution class in generate_parentheses.py offers a method generateParenthesis, which accepts an integer n and returns a list of strings representing all combinations of n pairs of balanced parentheses. This approach ensures optimal performance and minimal memory usage by dynamically constructing valid sequences, avoiding the complexity of recursive calls.
